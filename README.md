## Overview

The PT Application Inspector plugin finds vulnerabilities and undocumented features in application source code. In addition to code analysis, built-in modules detect errors in configuration files and vulnerabilities in third-party components and libraries used in application development. The plugin supports the following languages: C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Ruby, SQL, and TypeScript.

## How it works

### Enabling and disabling the plugin

You can enable or disable the plugin in the folder of an open project. If it is not the first time you are opening the project, the plugin is enabled automatically (scan and action history is saved). You can also set up the plugin to be automatically enabled when a new project is opened.

When the plugin is enabled, the **.ai** folder is created in the project. This folder contains a database, log files, and a configuration file.

### Installing the code analyzer

For the plugin to operate correctly, the PT Application Inspector code analyzer is required. You can install it automatically by clicking **Download Analyzer** in the pop-up notification in the Visual Studio Code interface or manually by downloading it from the link in the instructions below.

To manually install the code analyzer:

1. Download the archive with the analyzer using one of the links:

   * For Windows: [download](https://update.ptsecurity.com/api/v6/products/AI.INFRASTRUCTURE.INSTALLATOR.zip/2.2.1.35411/download/AI.INFRASTRUCTURE.INSTALLATOR.2.2.1.35411.zip)

   * For Linux: [download](https://update.ptsecurity.com/api/v6/products/AI.INFRASTRUCTURE.INSTALLATOR.tar.gz/2.2.1.35411/download/AI.INFRASTRUCTURE.INSTALLATOR.2.2.1.35411.tar.gz)

   * For macOS: [download](https://update.ptsecurity.com/api/v6/products/AI.INFRASTRUCTURE.INSTALLATOR.pkg/2.2.1.35411/download/AI.INFRASTRUCTURE.INSTALLATOR.2.2.1.35411.pkg)

1. In macOS, run the installation file and follow the instructions. In Windows and Linux, unpack the archive to one of the following locations:

   * In Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Application Inspector Analyzer`

   * In Linux: `~/application-inspector-analyzer`

### Scanning a project

You can start a project scan in the following ways:
* By clicking ![pic](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/raw/release/2.2.4/media/readme/start-scan.png) or ![pic](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/raw/release/2.2.4/media/readme/start-full-scan.png) in the **CODE SCANNING** section
* When saving project changes (if you selected **On saving** for the **Trigger scan** parameter)
* By running the command `PT Application Inspector: Start Scan`
* By running the command `PT Application Inspector: Start Full Scan`

***Note**. Before scanning, all changes to the project are automatically saved.*

You can monitor the scan progress on the **OUTPUT** tab. The first scan usually takes longer due to the initial load on the database of vulnerable components.

General scan settings are configured in the `.aiproj.json` configuration file. You can create a configuration file and configure scan settings in it by running the command `PT Application Inspector: Create Project Settings File`.

![Starting a scan](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/blob/release/2.2.4/media/readme/AI-start-scan.gif?raw=true)

### Stopping a scan

You can stop a project scan by running the command `PT Application Inspector: Stop Scan` or by clicking ![pic](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/raw/release/2.2.4/media/readme/stop-scan.png) in the **CODE SCANNING** section.

## Analyzing scan results

You can find the list of all detected vulnerabilities in the **PROBLEMS** tab and in the **CODE SCANNING** section. If you click a vulnerability in the list, the line with its exit point gets highlighted in the code editor.

The **DATA FLOW** section contains a data-flow diagram that shows how each process converts its input data to output data and how processes interact.

The data-flow diagram consists of the following sections:
* **Entry point**. The starting point of the control flow.
* **Data entry point**. The file and code line with the coordinates of the data entry.
* **Data changes**. The description of one or several functions that modify potentially harmful input data. This section may not be displayed on the diagram if the input data were not modified.
* **Exit point**. The execution line of a potentially vulnerable function. This is the exit point related to the vulnerability in the source code.
* **Best place to fix**. The code line best suited for patching a vulnerability. This section is displayed before the data flow.

You can go to the corresponding place in the code editor from any section of the data-flow diagram.

![The [PT AI] Data flow section](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/blob/release/2.2.4/media/readme/AI-data-flow.gif?raw=true)

The **EXPLOIT** section contains an automatically generated HTTP request (exploit) that you can edit and use to check the vulnerability in a deployed web application.

***Note.** To exploit a vulnerability, specify the address of the host where your web application is deployed in the `.aiproj.json` file. The default value is "localhost."*

***Note.** To send an HTTP request, a third-party extension is required. It is recommended that you use the REST client.*

![Vulnerability exploitation](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/blob/release/2.2.4/media/readme/AI-exploit.gif?raw=true)

Some vulnerabilities have additional exploitation conditions. They are displayed under **ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS**.

The contents of the **PT APPLICATION INSPECTOR** sections depend on the code line selected in the editor.

When you scroll through the sections of the diagram, the vulnerability information is automatically pinned until you move on to another vulnerability. If you want to view information about a certain vulnerability while working on the code, you can pin this vulnerability manually.

![Pinning a vulnerability](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/blob/release/2.2.4/media/readme/AI-pin-unpin.gif?raw=true)

Several vulnerabilities can have the same exit point. If these vulnerabilities belong to the same type, they are grouped together and displayed as one problem with different exploitation options. In **PT APPLICATION INSPECTOR** sections, use the left and right arrows to view detailed information about such vulnerabilities.

***Note**. If you confirm one vulnerability from the group, the whole problem will be confirmed automatically. To discard an entire problem, you must discard all the vulnerabilities in the group.*

### Managing detected vulnerabilities

The PT Application Inspector plugin contains a set of tools for managing detected vulnerabilities. With these tools, you can do the following:
* Confirm or discard vulnerabilities in the following ways:
   * By clicking ![pic](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/raw/release/2.2.4/media/readme/confirm.png) or ![pic](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/raw/release/2.2.4/media/readme/discard.png) in **PT APPLICATION INSPECTOR** sections
   * Using the vulnerability context menu in the **PROBLEMS** tab
   * Using the **Quick Fix** context menu displayed next to the highlighted vulnerability in the code editor.
* Suppress vulnerabilities from scan results by selecting **Suppress vulnerability (PT AI)** in the vulnerability context menu in the **PROBLEMS** tab or in the **Quick Fix** context menu.
* View vulnerability descriptions by selecting **Show description for <vulnerability name> (PT AI)** in the vulnerability context menu in the **PROBLEMS** tab or in the **Quick Fix** context menu.
* Filter vulnerabilities by severity, status, and suppression from scan results by running the command `PT Application Inspector: Show Vulnerabilities` or by clicking ![pic](https://github.com/POSIdev-community/AI.Plugin.VSCode/raw/release/2.2.4/media/readme/filter.png) in the **CODE SCANNING** section.
